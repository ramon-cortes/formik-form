### Build a Formik Form Assignment

This files only worked on my pc using
**npm start**
And only using **Node.js 14.19.3**

They do not seem to work uploaded in GitHub

Tried using the following command and uploading the /build directory, but that does not work:
npm run build

So I only uploaded the files I edited:
/public/index.html
/public/index.css
/src/App.js
/src/index.css

Not sure how to upload a project created with npm install & npm start. They seem to create a lot (40,000) files in the directory
