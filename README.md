### Build a Formik Form Assignment

I only uploaded the important files (AKA the files I edited). They would need to be placed in the **original location folder**:

- **index.html** (original location: /public)

- **index.css** (original location: /public & /src)

- **App.js** (original location: /src)

- **index.js** (original location: /src)

This files only worked on my pc by using as instructed

*npm start*

and only using *Node.js 14.19.3*

They do not seem to work uploaded in GitHub

Tried using the following command and uploading the /build directory, but that does not work:

*npm run build*

Not sure how to upload into GitHub a project created with npm install & npm start. They seem to create a lot (40,000) files in the directory
