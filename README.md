### Build a Formik Form Assignment

This files only worked on my pc using

*npm start*

and only using *Node.js 14.19.3*

They do not seem to work uploaded in GitHub

Tried using the following command and uploading the /build directory, but that does not work:

*npm run build*

So I only uploaded the important files (AKA the files I edited). They need to be placed in the **original location folder**:

- **index.html** (original location: /public)

- **index.css** (original location: /public & /src)

- **App.js** (original location: /src)

- **index.js** (original location: /src)

Not sure how to upload a project created with npm install & npm start. They seem to create a lot (40,000) files in the directory
